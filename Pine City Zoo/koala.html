                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are marsupials native to Australia. They are known for their fluffy ears, spoon-shaped noses, and tree-dwelling lifestyle. Koalas primarily eat eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and toxic to most other animals.
                    </p>
                    <p>They sleep up to 18â€“22 hours a day to conserve energy and are mostly solitary creatures. Koalas carry their young (joeys) in a pouch and are found in eucalyptus forests along the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find koalas at pen 18, near the Australian outback zone.</p>
