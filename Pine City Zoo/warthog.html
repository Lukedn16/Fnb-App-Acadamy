    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p>
        Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild members of the pig family found in grasslands, savannahs, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. They are recognizable by their large tusks and facial warts, which are actually protective pads.
    </p>
    <p>
        Warthogs are omnivores, feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and occasionally carrion. They often kneel on their front knees while grazing and are known for their speed and alertness when escaping predators.
    </p>
    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
    <p>You will find warthogs at pen 12, near the watering hole exhibit.</p>
