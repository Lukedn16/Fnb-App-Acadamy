    <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p>
        Lions (Panthera leo) are large carnivorous cats native to Africa and parts of India. Known as "the king of the jungle," lions live in social groups called prides, which typically consist of related females, their cubs, and a few males.

    <p>
        Lions are apex predators, hunting animals such as antelope, zebras, and buffalo. Males are known for their impressive manes, which vary in color and size. They are most active at night and spend much of the day resting or sleeping.
