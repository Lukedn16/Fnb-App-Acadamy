                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>
                        The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope species native to arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly in the Kalahari Desert. Known for their striking appearance, gemsboks have long, straight horns (which both males and females possess), and distinctive black and white facial markings that contrast with their fawn-colored bodies. Their horns can grow up to 85 cm (33 in) long and are used for defense and establishing dominance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are highly adapted to dry environments and can survive without water for long periods by getting moisture from the plants they eat. They are herbivores and primarily graze on grasses, herbs, and shrubs. These antelope are well known for their strength and resilience in harsh desert climates.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find gemsboks at pen 7, near the desert exhibit area.</p>
