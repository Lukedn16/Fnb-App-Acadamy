                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>
                        Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest land animals on Earth, known for their exceptionally long necks and legs. They inhabit savannahs and open woodlands across parts of Africa. Their height allows them to browse leaves and buds from the tops of trees, particularly from acacias, which form a major part of their diet.
                    </p>
                    <p>Giraffes have distinctive coat patterns that help with camouflage and vary by subspecies. Despite their long necks, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as most other mammalsâ€”seven. Their strong hearts and unique blood vessel system help manage blood flow when bending down to drink. Giraffes are social animals and often move in loose herds.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find giraffes at pen 14, near the tall tree feeding station.</p>
