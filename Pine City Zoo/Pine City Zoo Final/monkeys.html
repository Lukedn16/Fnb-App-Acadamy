    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>
        Monkeys are primates found in many parts of the world, including tropical forests, savannahs, and mountainous regions. They are highly social animals and live in groups called troops. Monkeys are known for their intelligence, agility, and playful behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two main groups: New World monkeys (from Central and South America) and Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia). They differ in physical traits, such as prehensile tails in many New World species, and in diet and behavior.
