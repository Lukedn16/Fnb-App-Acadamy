    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>
        Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are native to the mountain forests of central China. They are known for their distinctive black-and-white fur and gentle nature. Pandas primarily eat bamboo, which makes up more than 99% of their diet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pandas are solitary animals and spend most of their day eating or sleeping. They are a conservation symbol worldwide and efforts to protect their habitats have helped stabilize their population in the wild.
