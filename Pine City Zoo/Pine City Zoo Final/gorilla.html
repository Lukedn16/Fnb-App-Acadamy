                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gorillas are the largest primates and are closely related to humans, sharing about 98% of our DNA. They live in the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa and are divided into two main species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla. Known for their intelligence, gorillas use tools, communicate through a variety of vocalizations and gestures, and display complex social behaviors.
                    </p>
                    <p>Gorillas live in groups led by a dominant male known as a silverback. These groups typically consist of several females and their offspring. Gorillas are mostly herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and shoots. Despite their powerful build, they are gentle and shy animals that play a crucial role in their ecosystems.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find gorillas at pen 10, near the rainforest enclosure.</p>
